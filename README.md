Website

Open source code for my website, feel free to look through code and use in own projects if you need.

Will be published soon to the actual domain and will hopefully be updated regularly.

**To do:**

- [x] ~Make it so that a h1 tag isn't required to load css in the startup() function~
- [ ] Edits pages so they actually have stuff on them
- [ ] ~Spread out buttons on top of screen (download button relocation)~
- [ ] Make download button + preview for projects page
- [x] ~Make links page better than just a clickable youtube logo lmfao~
- [x] ~Make sure Rainbow easter egg doesn't ruin the text color~
- [x] ~Link page is fixed on laptop, edit other pages in order to remove grid container (it's stupid for top bar)~

- [ ] Add text adevnture!!!!


**Short term goals:**

- [x] ~Custom 404 page~
- [ ] Make suvat calculator "project page" button not reidrect to /suvat/index.html and rather just /suvat/ as it looks nicer
