# xiler.co.uk
Website

Open source code for my website, feel free to look through code and use in own projects if you need.
Will be published soon to the actual domain and will hopefully be updated regularily. 

**To do:**

- [x] Make it so that a h1 tag isn't required to load css in the startup() function (100% - Implement soon)
- [ ] Edits pages so they actually have stuff on them (5%)
- [ ] Spread out buttons on top of screen (0%) 
- [ ] Make download button + preview for projects page (0%)
- [ ] Make links page better than just a clickable youtube logo lmfao (50%)
- [x] Make sure Rainbow easter egg doesn't ruin the text color
